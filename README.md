# alphagen Gallery

alphagen is a minting platform and art gallery built on top of the Solana blockchain.

alphagen NFTs are available for anyone to use. However, owning an ‘alpha NFT’ is your pass to create and mint curated projects on the alphagen platform.

The first alpha NFTs will be distributed for FREE to all Solana Monkey Business holders over a 3 day period. Unclaimed alpha NFTs will then be sold in a fair mint along with 100 genesis alpha NFTs.

There will be a total of 5,500 alpha NFTs.
## Roadmap

- Note: Roadmap is subject to change depending on community participation and votes.

## Anatomy

- alpha NFTs are 16 characters in a 4x4 matrix. Characters are normally distributed (i.e Bell Curve), where letters at the extremes (a, b, c, ...., x, y , z) are more rare than letters in the middle of the alphabet.
- alpha NFTs can be visually represented by any 26 character alphabet.

## Create

- Possessing an alpha NFT is your pass to our minting platform and gallery for curated art, music, games, competitions, and more.
- We will also provide open-source tools to developers and creatives who want to use alpha in their non-curated mints. We are extremely excited to see our community creates with the alpha primitive NFT.
